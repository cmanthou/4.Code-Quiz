# Code-Quiz

Live Demo: 

This assignment focused on creating a time quiz program. I handled this by replacing the values in the questions to use less html markup. I only ended up having 5 section tags with the data was handled within. Each of these sections I had showing or hidden depending on events such as time, completing the quiz or submitting a high score.

Used normalize.css (v8.0.1) to make browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with moidern standards.  Code pulled from https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/
